# hello-world
*Welcome to my repository built to explore git and github*

My goals in creating this repository are:
1. To better understand the github workflow
2. To become more comfortable navigating the website
3. To introduce myself to Markdown Syntax (while editing this readme)

So far in my introduction to R and RStudio, I have written the following code: [^1]
`example <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), nrow = 4, ncol = 2)`

[^1]: This code was written in week two of my Coursera class: The Data Scienctist's Toolbox.

Here are some definitions I've learned along the way:

**repository (repo)**
: the main storage place of all files and content relating to the project.

**commit**
: changes that have been saved to a version of a file. A commit should be purposeful, and address a single issue. They should include a descriptive comment to document the changes made.

**push**
: when you update the repo with your commits. The file goes from being local to being accessible anywhere through the repo.

**pull**
: when you update your local file versions to reflect the most updated repo.

**staging**
: to stage a file is to prepare for commit. Each file should be staged individually.

**branch**
: when the same file has two simultaneous copies (local and on the repo). They can be different, as the local copy is edited and committed before being pushed to the repo.

**merge**
: what happens when commits are integrated into the repo. A new file is created of the unchanged and changed parts of the file.

**conflict**
: when multiple commits are pushed to the repo, but one change may affect the viability of another. GitHub will flag conflicts and seek user assistance to either manually merge the commits or to accept one over the other.

**clone**
: a copy of an existing git repo, including all the file histories and versions.

**fork**
: a personal copy of a repo taken from someone else. Your changes are logged in your repo, not the original.

~~I've been having a hard time adjusting to the entirely new world of data science.~~

==I AM **LEARNING**, AND FEELING **FRUSTRATED** AND **DISCOURAGED** IS **NORMAL**. *I MAY NOT BE A MASTER NOW*, BUT WITH **TIME** AND **PRACTICE**, I WILL **KNOW** AND BE ABLE TO DO **SO MUCH MORE** THAN WHAT I CAN RIGHT NOW.==
